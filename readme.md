## StitchingSequence

Demonstrating image stitching without knowledge about geometries with one or multiple image sources.

### Description

There are two examples in this script. One only using the central camera out of three mounted over a conveyor and a second showing the result when combining several views. The results are presented as two combined images.

### How to Run

Starting this sample is possible either by running the App (F5) or debugging (F7+F10). Setting breakpoint on the first row inside the 'main' function allows debugging step-by-step after 'Engine.OnStarted' event. Results can be seen in the image viewer on the DevicePage. Restarting the Sample may be necessary to show images after loading the web-page.
To run this Sample a device with SICK Algorithm API and AppEngine >= V2.8.0 is required. For example SIM4000 with latest firmware. Alternatively the Emulator in AppStudio 2.4 or higher can be used.
